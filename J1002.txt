1.1  Name at least two other services that you perspnally use which are implemented using a client server model- I use Text messaging and Instagram.

1.2  It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why? - I believe it is important because it creates an easy way to find other peoples files because everything will have the same name.

2.1  Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it? - It is a unique name to represent the home directory and will not get confused with anything else.

2.2  Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful? - Yes, the prompt changes, this is useful to check and add new directories in different prompts.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?- I learned about the basic layout of files/ directories and basic commands such as changing from one directory to another.

What challenges did I encounter?- I struggled understanding how to download the extension and login 

How could this experience be improved?- Maybe the teacher could explain the codeing first before the website because sometimes the website rushes through things and is hard to understand.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?- I have learned to pay more attention to the small details the website says, and try to memorize as I go
